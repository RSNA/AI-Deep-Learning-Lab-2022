        "\n",
        "Access to large, high quality data is essential for researchers to understand disease and precision medicine pathways, especially in cancer. However HIPAA constraints make sharing medical images outside an individual institution a complex process. [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) TCIA is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute which addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers. \n",
        "\n",
        "TCIA has published over 175 unique data collections containing more than 60 million images. Recognizing that images alone are not enough to conduct meaningful research, most collections are linked to rich supporting data including patient outcomes, treatment information, genomic / proteomic analyses, and expert image analyses (segmentations, annotations, and radiomic / radiogenomic features). **In this course we will address basic use cases for identifying TCIA datasets of interest and downloading them via Jupyter Notebooks.** \n",

        "* Practice utilizing TCIA for data exploration, cohort definition, and downloading of data\n",
        "* Learn how to access public and restricted access datasets using TCIA's REST APIs and other command line tools via Google Colab"
