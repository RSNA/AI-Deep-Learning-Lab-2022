# Best Practices for Model Training: Architectures, Hyperparameters, & Optimization

In this tutorial we will explore best practices for building modern CNN models, including recommendations for baseline (simple but robust) design choices as well as advanced motifs including separable convolutions in combination with alternative normalization and activation functions. In addition we will examine strategies for tracking model performance across a variety of network architecture and hyperparameter configurations.
